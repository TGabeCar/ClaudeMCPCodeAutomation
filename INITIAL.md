## PROJECT_SOURCE:

C:\Users\Gabe\source\repos\ImThatKidAI\GeminiService.cs
C:\Users\Gabe\source\repos\ImThatKidAI-SecurityFunctions\GeminiProxyFunction.cs

## FEATURE:

I want to fix the Gemini API call to use the paid version rather than the free version. I want the cheapest version that will still achieve my goal. I want to keep all existing functionality, but 

## RELEVANT_CODE:

GeminiService.cs
GeminiProxyFunctions.cs

## EXAMPLES:

## DOCUMENTATION:

## OTHER CONSIDERATIONS:

I want to keep all existing functionality and my prompt building system, but if you see areas which can be improved, like for efficiency or error handling, you can implement those changes.
