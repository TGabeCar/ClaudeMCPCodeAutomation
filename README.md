# Context Engineering Template - Microsoft Stack

A comprehensive template for getting started with Context Engineering for .NET applications - the discipline of engineering context for AI coding assistants so they have the information necessary to get the job done end to end with C#, ASP.NET Core, Entity Framework, and MAUI.

> **Context Engineering is 10x better than prompt engineering and 100x better than vibe coding.**

## 🚀 Quick Start

## What is Context Engineering?

Context Engineering represents a paradigm shift from traditional prompt engineering:

### Prompt Engineering vs Context Engineering

**Prompt Engineering:**
- Focuses on clever wording and specific phrasing
- Limited to how you phrase a task
- Like giving someone a sticky note

**Context Engineering:**
- A complete system for providing comprehensive context
- Includes documentation, examples, rules, patterns, and validation
- Like writing a full screenplay with all the details

### Why Context Engineering Matters

1. **Reduces AI Failures**: Most agent failures aren't model failures - they're context failures
2. **Ensures Consistency**: AI follows your .NET project patterns and conventions
3. **Enables Complex Features**: AI can handle multi-project implementations with proper context
4. **Self-Correcting**: Validation loops allow AI to fix its own mistakes

This template focuses on .NET-specific patterns and doesn't include complex architecture patterns that will be covered in future releases.

## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Set Up Global Rules (CLAUDE.md)

The `CLAUDE.md` file contains project-wide rules that the AI assistant will follow in every conversation. The template includes:

- **Project awareness**: Reading planning docs, checking tasks
- **Code structure**: Project organization, namespace conventions
- **Testing requirements**: xUnit test patterns, coverage expectations
- **Style conventions**: C# language preferences, formatting rules
- **Documentation standards**: XML documentation formats, commenting practices

**You can use the provided template as-is or customize it for your .NET project.**

### 2. Create Your Initial Feature Request

Edit `INITIAL.md` to describe what you want to build:

```markdown
## FEATURE:
[Describe what you want to build - be specific about functionality and requirements]

## EXAMPLES:
[List any example files in the examples/ folder and explain how they should be used]

## DOCUMENTATION:
[Include links to relevant Microsoft documentation, NuGet packages, or API resources]

## OTHER CONSIDERATIONS:
[Mention any gotchas, specific requirements, or things AI assistants commonly miss with .NET]
```

**See `INITIAL_EXAMPLE.md` for a complete example.**

### 3. Generate the PRP

PRPs (Product Requirements Prompts) are comprehensive implementation blueprints that include:

- Complete context and documentation
- Implementation steps with validation
- Error handling patterns
- Test requirements

They are similar to PRDs (Product Requirements Documents) but are crafted more specifically to instruct an AI coding assistant for .NET development.

Run in Claude Code:
```bash
/generate-prp INITIAL.md
```

**Note:** The slash commands are custom commands defined in `.claude/commands/`. You can view their implementation:
- `.claude/commands/generate-prp.md` - See how it researches and creates PRPs
- `.claude/commands/execute-prp.md` - See how it implements features from PRPs

The `$ARGUMENTS` variable in these commands receives whatever you pass after the command name (e.g., `INITIAL.md` or `PRPs/your-feature.md`).

This command will:
1. Read your feature request
2. Research the codebase for .NET patterns
3. Search for relevant Microsoft documentation
4. Create a comprehensive PRP in `PRPs/your-feature-name.md`

### 4. Execute the PRP

Once generated, execute the PRP to implement your feature:

```bash
/execute-prp PRPs/your-feature-name.md
```

The AI coding assistant will:
1. Read all context from the PRP
2. Create a detailed implementation plan
3. Execute each step with validation
4. Run tests and fix any issues
5. Ensure all success criteria are met

## Writing Effective INITIAL.md Files

### Key Sections Explained

**FEATURE**: Be specific and comprehensive
- ❌ "Build a web API"
- ✅ "Build an ASP.NET Core Web API using Entity Framework Core that manages product inventory, implements JWT authentication, and provides real-time updates via SignalR"

**EXAMPLES**: Leverage the examples/ folder
- Place relevant C# code patterns in `examples/`
- Reference specific files and patterns to follow
- Explain what aspects should be mimicked

**DOCUMENTATION**: Include all relevant resources
- Microsoft Docs URLs
- NuGet package documentation
- API documentation
- Database schema references

**OTHER CONSIDERATIONS**: Capture important details
- Authentication requirements
- Performance requirements
- Common .NET pitfalls
- Cross-platform considerations for MAUI

## The PRP Workflow

### How /generate-prp Works

The command follows this process:

1. **Research Phase**
   - Analyzes your codebase for .NET patterns
   - Searches for similar implementations
   - Identifies conventions to follow

2. **Documentation Gathering**
   - Fetches relevant Microsoft documentation
   - Includes NuGet package documentation
   - Adds .NET-specific gotchas and quirks

3. **Blueprint Creation**
   - Creates step-by-step implementation plan
   - Includes validation gates
   - Adds test requirements

4. **Quality Check**
   - Scores confidence level (1-10)
   - Ensures all context is included

### How /execute-prp Works

1. **Load Context**: Reads the entire PRP
2. **Plan**: Creates detailed task list using TodoWrite
3. **Execute**: Implements each component
4. **Validate**: Runs tests and analyzers
5. **Iterate**: Fixes any issues found
6. **Complete**: Ensures all requirements met

See `PRPs/EXAMPLE_api_service_prp.md` for a complete example of what gets generated.

## Using Examples Effectively

The `examples/` folder is **critical** for success. AI coding assistants perform much better when they can see .NET patterns to follow.

### What to Include in Examples

1. **Project Structure Patterns**
   - How you organize solutions and projects
   - Namespace conventions
   - Dependency injection patterns

2. **Testing Patterns**
   - xUnit test project structure
   - Mocking approaches with Moq
   - Integration testing patterns

3. **API Patterns**
   - Controller implementations
   - Service layer patterns
   - Authentication and authorization

4. **Data Access Patterns**
   - Entity Framework contexts
   - Repository patterns
   - Migration strategies

### Example Structure

```
examples/
├── README.md           # Explains what each example demonstrates
├── Program.cs         # Startup and DI configuration pattern
├── Controllers/       # API controller patterns
│   └── ProductController.cs
├── Services/          # Service layer patterns
│   ├── IProductService.cs
│   └── ProductService.cs
├── Models/            # Domain models and DTOs

└── Tests/            # Testing patterns
    ├── ProductServiceTests.cs
    └── ProductControllerTests.cs
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Be Explicit in INITIAL.md
- Don't assume the AI knows your .NET preferences
- Include specific requirements and constraints
- Reference examples liberally

### 2. Provide Comprehensive Examples
- More examples = better implementations
- Show both what to do AND what not to do
- Include error handling patterns

### 3. Use Validation Gates
- PRPs include commands that must pass
- AI will iterate until all validations succeed
- This ensures working code on first try

### 4. Leverage Microsoft Documentation
- Include official Microsoft Docs links
- Add NuGet package resources
- Reference specific documentation sections

### 5. Customize CLAUDE.md
- Add your .NET conventions
- Include project-specific rules
- Define coding standards
